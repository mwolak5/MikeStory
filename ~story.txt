This is a story about a man named Dave. Dave loves to snowboard, and he goes on 
vacation in Colorado every year. One year, while Dave was on his annual vacation, a 
massive blizzard rolled through the mountains. What happens next will shock you. 
Dave, being the living god that he is, anticipated the blizzard through the change in 
local atmosphereic pressure. Unfortunatly Dave is very selfesh and instead of helping

in Czechoslovakia (1919).
